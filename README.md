# Android Take Home Test


In this project, you will have a news feed activity. It retrieves the data from the local JSON file. JSON is parsed manually and elements has been created from the parsed data.

All the logical operations are happening in `MyNewsActivity.kt` and the layout for the list items is stored in `news_item.xml` file. There is only one data class for `News` element and it's in `model` folder.
