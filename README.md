The purpose of this test is to evaluate your technical skills, communication and mindset.

Please refactor the project according to the industry standards and aim for a performant, maintainable and tested solution.
You have *one* week time to work on the test, but our expectations are that 2 hours should be enough to finish it.

## Procedure

1. Complete the challenge.

- A meaningful commit history (git) will be a plus.
- Feel free to add some comments or provide information in the `README.md` file about things you would like to improve but didn't have time for this.

## Project

In this project, you will have a news feed activity. It retrieves the data from the local JSON file. JSON is parsed manually and elements has been created from the parsed data.

All the logical operations are happening in `MyNewsActivity.kt` and the layout for the list items is stored in `news_item.xml` file. There is only one data class for `News` element and it's in `model` folder.

The Application is written in Kotlin.

You are free to suggest and implement any library or code snippet that you think that is going to be useful  for the codebase. But please be sure to add detailed information about your suggestions and why they would be useful.
